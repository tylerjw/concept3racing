The highly-anticipated racing season has officially kicked off, and Concept 3 Racing is excited to share our first race experience with our fans and supporters.
On Sunday, April 16, our team participated in the "Run Your Rust Off" race at Action Karting, marking a milestone as we welcomed our first arrive-and-drive customer.
Despite challenging weather conditions, our team learned, adapted, and made a promising start to the season.
This blog post will give you a detailed account of our weekend adventure and share our plans for the upcoming races.

To ensure our driver was comfortable and secure during the race, we installed in a seat sized for our driver and fabricated mounts for the ballast weight, similar to an engine mount.
This attention to detail and customization allowed our drivers to focus on the race and perform at their best.

Saturday, April 15, served as the practice day for our race team.
Although the weather was cold and windy, our dedicated team members braved the elements to get out on the track and learn more about the new tires introduced this season.
These tires, which are faster than the old Duros, required our team to adapt our setup and techniques to maximize their performance.

Sunday, April 16, race day, the weather was perfect.
It was a comfortable still day with the warm Colorado sun.
The race was mostly without incident if you don't count Mark's broken steering column in the pre-final, which he quickly repaired.
Mark charged from the back of the final to 5th place with a repaired kart, passing ten karts in the 14-lap race.

After the race, our team gathered to review our performance and discuss lessons learned.
The consensus was that "Run Your Rust Off" was a successful outing for Concept 3 Racing, and we've decided to continue competing for the rest of the season.

As we look ahead, we're thrilled to announce that we have a driver signed up for the next race.
Our team is eager to build on the momentum from our first race and continue to provide an exceptional arrive-and-drive experience for our customers.

We look forward to sharing more of our journey with you as the season unfolds.
