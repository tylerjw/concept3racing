## Safety
Safety is our number one priority on and off the track.
You have been provided a kart that we feel is safe to use and we would be willing to race.
If at any time there is something that you feel we need to look at you must bring it to our attention immediately for evaluation.
Failure to do so may result in (but not limited to) reduced track time, increased cost to you, disqualification, injury, or death.

## Rules
You will be expected to follow the [rules and regulations governing CKT](
https://www.coloradokartingtour.com/general-resources/)

## On and Off Track Conduct

We expect you to conduct yourself in a courteous and professional manner before, during, and after the event.
Abusive, threatening, or aggressive behavior will not be tolerated.
Failure to follow these guidelines may be grounds for actions such as your removal from the event or track.
No refunds will be provided and additional penalties or fees may be assessed to you for such behavior.

These karts are durable but not indestructible.
Excessive bumping, curb cutting, crashes, driving off track, or other potentially dangerous driving may result in (but not limited to) reduced track time, increased cost to you, disqualification, injury, or death.
Care should be exercised for the duration of the event.

We do not run or control the event or venue.
All directions from track officials, owners, club board members shall be followed and all decisions they make are final.
