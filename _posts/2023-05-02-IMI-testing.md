Yesterday we tested some setup changes for the upcoming race this weekend.
I'm working on getting faster with the new tires and practicing creating a video with a data overlay using RaceRender.
Enjoy a couple laps onboard my LO206 around IMI Motorsports Park.
A kind fellow kart racer took the above photo of Ryan and me.
