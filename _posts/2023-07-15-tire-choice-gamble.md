Leading into the double header at Pikes Peak International Raceway every racer was keeping a close eye on the weather forcasts.
A typical afternoon thunderstorm with rain looked likely on Saturday. Watching the darkening clouds after the pre-final everyone got their rain tires out and prepared to make setup changes.
Down came the rain with some lightning which put a pause on the racing.

While waiting on the lighting to stop out came the rain tires and many racers wrenched on their karts to change the setup for a wet track.
The lighting stopped and the rain got lighter, a rain race was declared by race control.
Up first, while it was still raining was the KA100 class.

I (Tyler) raced in this class and went out on wets.
This was my first weekend racing in this class and I am just coming to terms with controlling a kart with three times the power of the Briggs motor.
Racing in the rain was sketchy and fun and I was releaved to manage to just finish the race without crashing.

Following the KA100 class was the LO206 Heavy and Masters race.
The track was still wet but it had stopped raining so many karts were staged on grid with both wets and slicks.
Most drivers took, including Mark, the conservative tire choice and went out on rain tires.

### Ryan, however, made the risky tire choice, racing on slick tires on a wet track that is drying.

As the race started Ryan struggled a bit with the kart snapping sideways as he drove it through the standing water in the first few laps.
By lap 3 he had falled from 3rd to 6th place but was doing his best to not loose too much time.

At that point the sun came out and the track started drying out fast.
Mike Webber who started much further back started also on slicks started picking up pace and one by one was picking off the field.
Ryan also started finding grip and we watched on Race Monitor as his lap times got faster and faster while the rest of the field got slower.

By the 6th lap of 14 Mike and Ryan had hooked up, the sun was out and they were picking off the field one by one.
Their lap times were 2 seconds faster than the leaders at this point and they were closing in.

With a few laps to go their tire choice was obviously the right one as they had pulled away from the field finishing first and second.
