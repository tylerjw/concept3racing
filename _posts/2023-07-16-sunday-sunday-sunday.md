Dalton, a professional sim racer, joined our team for the double header at PPIR.
This is his second year running this race with the CKT.
Having four races of experience he was no longer a rookie.

Leaning on his expert setup knoledge and understanding of vehicle dynamics from sim racing he made small changes to the kart setup throuout the weekend.
These changes enabled Dalton to gain confidence and get lower and lower lap times with every session.

The Concept 3 Racing team has a history of hosting drivers who are experienced in other forms of motorsports in a racing kart.
We work with racers to leverage their experience in kart racing to give them a fun and competitive weekend of kart racing.

There is a large difference between doing open lapping in a rental kart and competing in a wheel to wheel race in the CKT.
When you race with the Concept 3 Racing team we make that transition easy.

## Tyler Races KA100

The KA100 class is the step up from the LO206 class in terms of power and grip.
The KA100 motor makes three times the power and the Envico Blue tires offter loads of grip.
In terms of lap times the KA100 class did laps around PPIR in 57 seconds while the LO206 Heavy class was doing laps of 1min 8sec.

Having only a handful of practice days at IMI, the races at PPIR were my first time going wheel to wheel in a KA100.
I had no bad contact with other karts and managed to trade position back and forth with other racers cleanly.
It was intense and I am very happy with my performance finishing on the same lap as the leader and not having any bad off-track events.
