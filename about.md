Welcome to Concept 3 Racing. We’re a small kart racing team based in Denver, Colorado.
Founded by three friends with a passion for all things racing, and over 50 years of combined motorsports experience, we’re excited for our next chapter.

This year, we’re offering a race kart rental/arrive and drive program for all 2023 Colorado Karting Tour events.
Our goal is to allow new racers to try karting at its highest level in our state. Please contact us for more information.
