Welcome to Concept 3 Racing. Founded by three friends with a passion for all things racing, and over 50 years of combined motorsports experience, we’re excited for our next chapter.

This year, we’re offering an arrive and drive program for all 2023 Colorado Karting Tour events.
Our goal is to enable racers to try karting at its highest level in our state, without the expense and hassle of owning a kart. Please contact us for more information (info@concept3racing.com)
